Our team of Developers make sure that Lazap is customizable, Meet up the user's need and have a glancing & modernish look - meaning, custom JavaScript & CSS scripts, games outside the launchers we support and much more!

# Building Lazap (Developers & Contributers)
Building Lazap is very simple. Simply run these commands in order and you should be good to go:<br>
__NOTE:__ Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed
```
git clone https://github.com/DashCruft-Nation/lazap.git
cd lazap
git switch nightly
npm i
npm start
```
And if you did everything right, Lazap should start right up!

After doing those, if you would like to have the `exe` file (and the installable), rather then running a cmd each time, simply run the following:
```
npm run build
```
Then you should see a new directory named `dist`. Open it up and you can easily figure everything out yourself.
